# Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains experiments and implementations of fundamental reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms applied to discrete grid-world environments. The aim is to explore how agents can learn through interaction to maximise rewards in environments.

The experiments were conducted as part of a technical exploration into RL methods, including:

- Dynamic programming (Policy Iteration, Value Iteration)
- Temporal Difference learning (SARSA, Expected SARSA, Q-Learning)
- Function approximation in high-dimensional state spaces

The environments include:
- Small world
- Cliff world
- Grid world
- A dynamic variant of small world with varying barrier configurations

The full discussion of the methodologies are present in the discussion pdf.
